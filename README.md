## Fine-Tuning LLAMA3 on Google Colab

This project demonstrates fine-tuning the LLAMA3 language model on Google Colab, focusing on NLP tasks using the **mental_health_counseling_conversations** dataset. 

- **Environment Setup**: Configure Colab with Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers).
- **Model & Dataset**: Download LLAMA3, preprocess the mental health counseling dataset, and adapt it for fine-tuning.
- **Fine-Tuning & Evaluation**: Customize the model, optimize with hyperparameters, and evaluate performance with metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in fine-tuning large language models for specialized NLP tasks. By working with the LLAMA3 model and the **mental_health_counseling_conversations** dataset, the project aims to:

1. **Enhance Model Customization Skills**: Learn to adapt pre-trained models for specific use cases, focusing on tasks within the mental health domain.
2. **Develop Evaluation Proficiency**: Build skills in evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy and F1 score.
3. **Explore Real-World Applications**: Potentially deploy the fine-tuned model for real-world scenarios, such as creating supportive conversational agents.
4. **Strengthen Technical Proficiency in NLP**: Deepen understanding of NLP workflows, model architectures, and best practices for optimizing large language models.

This project provides practical, resume-building experience in deep learning and NLP within a meaningful, socially impactful context.
