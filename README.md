**Fine-Tuning LLAMA3**

This project demonstrates fine-tuning the LLAMA3 language model on Google Colab, focusing on NLP tasks using the mental_health_counseling_conversations dataset.

- **Environment Setup**: Configured Colab with Python libraries (e.g., PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers).
- **Model & Dataset**: Downloaded LLAMA3, preprocessed the mental health counseling dataset, and adapted it for fine-tuning.
- **Fine-Tuning & Evaluation**: Customized the model, optimized with hyperparameters, and evaluated performance with metrics like accuracy and F1 score.

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in fine-tuning large language models for specialized NLP tasks. By working with the LLAMA3 model and the mental_health_counseling_conversations dataset, the project aims to:

- **Enhance Model Customization Skills**: Adapt pre-trained models for specific use cases, focusing on tasks within the mental health domain.
- **Develop Evaluation Proficiency**: Build skills in evaluating model performance through metrics like accuracy and F1 score.
- **Explore Real-World Applications**: Potentially deploy the fine-tuned model for real-world scenarios, such as creating supportive conversational agents.
- **Strengthen Technical Proficiency in NLP**: Deepen understanding of NLP workflows, model architectures, and best practices for optimizing large language models.

This project provides practical, resume-building experience in deep learning and NLP within a meaningful, socially impactful context.
